- At the moment we have the virtual environment, we just need to intall flask and mesa now
- Flask: pip install flask
- Mesa: pip install mesa

After installing everything you are ready to run the simulation

#### Run the simulation

If you are in the parent folder, redirect yourself to the folder 2D_SImulation with the following command: cd 2D_SImulation

When you are in this new folder just run python server.py to run the server flask for it to work in unity. Or run server_2D.py, to run the simulation on html and in 2D.

If you decided to run the flask server, you will need to open the unity project and play the scene called BuildCity
